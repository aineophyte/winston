Project Idea

Connect Four AI game that uses Mini/Max Alpha Beta.

Some for the idea goes to MIT professor and AI pioneer Patrick Winston.  One of the lab assignments from MIT Open Courseware's
6.034 Artificial Intelligence class offered in the fall of 2010, https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010,
was 'Game Search'.  It was some working python code that allowed a user to play Connect Four against the program that used mini/max depth
first search to a depth of 4.  The assignment was to implememt a better static evaluation function than the supplied default one to score
the game boards used by the mini/max alpha beta algorithm.  I never really attempted to do anything with this one other than get the Python 2.x
code working in Python 3.x.  I really haven't spent any time looking at the details of the Python code since my intent is to do something from
scratch.

The other goal of the project is to implement it with some modern technologies.

UI: possibly React JS

Backend: gRPC with Java, Cassandra data store, maybe eventually use Kubernetes to kick off the services.


gRPC services

StartGame (option for letting AI make the move for either or both players)

GetBoard

ExecuteTurn

GetGameList


Optional:

Possibly keep a player archive too instead of just entered names for each new game.

More than Mini/Max Alpha Beta where board sequences are saved for each completed game to use in a hybrid algorithm or maybe the historical
board sequences can be used by the scoring algorithm.
